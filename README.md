## üìñ Overview

MvxLib is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify MultiversX blockchain development. It provides an intuitive environment where developers of all skill levels can explore SDKs, interact with ABIs, test smart contracts, and share community components.

**üì¢ This project was created for the MultiversX AI Hackathon 2024.**

### üåü Key Features

- **SDK Discovery & Analysis** - Explore the structure and features of MultiversX SDKs
- **Interactive ABI Testing** - Test smart contract functions directly in your browser
- **AI-Powered Assistance** - Get context-aware help for development challenges
- **Community Component Library** - Share and reuse components with the community
- **Learning Resources** - Follow guided paths to master MultiversX development

## üé¨ Demo

- **Live Demo**: [Coming Soon]
- **Video Walkthrough**: [Coming Soon]

## üíª Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Supabase Database
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- **MultiversX**: SDK Integration for JavaScript, Rust, Python, etc.

## ü§ñ Development Workflow

This project was developed using AI-assisted workflows:

- **Concept & Design**: Initial ideas and architecture created with Grok 3 and ChatGPT
- **Initial Development**: Core implementation with Lovable AI assistance and V0 prototype creation
- **Refinement**: Code optimization and feature enhancement using Cursor IDE with Claude 3.7 Sonnet

> **‚ö†Ô∏è AI-Generated Content Notice**: Some scripts and code in this project were partially generated by AI assistants and may contain errors or require optimization for production use. Always review and test thoroughly before deploying to production environments.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- NPM or Yarn
- Google Generative AI API Key (for AI features)
- MultiversX testnet account (optional, for transaction testing)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mvxlib.git
cd mvxlib

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local to add your API keys
```

### Configuration

1. Configure your `.env.local` file with the necessary API keys:

```
# AI API Keys
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here

# MultiversX Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTIVERSX_NETWORK=devnet

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

2. For Supabase setup, you need to:
   - Create a project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
   - Run the SQL scripts in the `db` folder to set up required tables and functions
   - Add your Supabase project URL and keys to the environment variables
   - Ensure the service role key is kept secure and only used in server-side code

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.
